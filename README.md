## Quillio

Create SEO-ready blogs from YouTube videos. Transform video content into well-structured, search-engine optimized articles automatically.

> **Note:** This template is opinionated and built for my own apps. It's designed specifically for:
> - **Stripe-only billing** — Polar and other payment providers will not be supported
> - **Multi-tenant orgs** — each user can own multiple organizations, but only the first org gets a free trial
> - **No single-tenant mode** — this is not designed for single-user or personal-use SaaS apps
>
> Feel free to fork and adapt, but these constraints are intentional and won't change.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Nuxt 4 + Vue 3 + TypeScript |
| Auth | Better Auth |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM + Cloudflare Hyperdrive |
| Billing | Stripe (subscriptions, seats, plan versioning) |
| Emails | React Email + Resend |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/paulchrisluke/quill-nuxsaas.git
cd quill-nuxsaas

# 2. Use Node.js v22 LTS
nvm use

# 3. Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in env vars (database, Stripe, auth, etc.)

# 4. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 5. Generate and apply database migrations
pnpm run db:generate
pnpm run db:migrate

# 6. Start development server
pnpm run dev -o
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Database Migrations
Before deploying to production, ensure database migrations are applied:

```bash
# Generate migration files (if schema changed)
pnpm run db:generate

# Apply migrations to database
pnpm run db:migrate
```

**Important**: Run migrations before deploying your application to ensure the database schema is up-to-date. This is especially important for the `isAnonymous` column added to the user table for anonymous session support.

**Deploy to production:**

```bash
npx nuxthub deploy
```

### Environment Variables

**Important:** Set `NUXT_APP_URL` to your production URL for Better Auth to work correctly.

```bash
# .env
NUXT_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

This URL is used by Better Auth for:
- OAuth callback URLs
- Email verification links
- Password reset links
- CORS origin validation

The origin is configured in `server/utils/auth.ts`:

```typescript
export const createBetterAuth = () => betterAuth({
  baseURL: runtimeConfig.public.baseURL,
  trustedOrigins: [
    'http://localhost:8787',
    'http://localhost:3000',
    // ... other local origins
    runtimeConfig.public.baseURL  // Your production URL
  ],
  // ...
})
```

Your `NUXT_APP_URL` is automatically added to `trustedOrigins` via `runtimeConfig.public.baseURL`.

### Recommended Hosting

**Recommended stack:**
- **Cloudflare Workers** — serverless hosting via [NuxHub](https://hub.nuxt.com)
- **Neon Postgres** — serverless PostgreSQL database
- **Cloudflare Hyperdrive** — connection pooling for Postgres

**Caching:**
- **Cloudflare KV** — no Redis needed when hosting on Cloudflare (used for session caching, rate limiting)
- **Redis** — use Redis if you're not on Cloudflare (Upstash, Railway, Vercel etc.)

The app automatically uses Cloudflare KV when deployed to Cloudflare Workers. No additional configuration needed.

## Features

### Billing & Subscriptions

- **Stripe-powered billing** with monthly/yearly Pro plans
- **Legacy pricing support** — existing subscribers stay on their original price forever
- **Seat-based pricing** — base plan includes 1 seat, extra members cost per-seat
- **Detailed previews** before any billing change (seat changes, plan switches, trial conversions)
- **Invoice history** with pagination and PDF downloads
- **Declined card handling** with graceful recovery flows
- **Grace period support** for failed payments before auto-cancellation

#### Stripe Subscription Status Flow

| Status | When | What Happens |
|--------|------|--------------|
| `incomplete` | User opens Stripe Checkout but doesn't complete payment | Waiting for initial payment — use for retargeting abandoned checkouts |
| `trialing` | User starts a free trial | Full access during trial period |
| `active` | Payment succeeds (after trial or direct subscribe) | Full access, billing active |
| `past_due` | Payment fails on renewal | Grace period — user sees warning banners, can update payment method |
| `canceled` | Grace period ends or user canceled and billing cycle current date is past the billing cycle end date | Stripe sends webhook, access revoked, excess team members removed |

**How it works:**
1. When a payment fails, Stripe sets `status = "past_due"` and retries automatically
2. During the grace period (configured in Stripe Dashboard), users see warning banners and can update their payment method
3. If payment isn't resolved, Stripe sends a webhook after the grace period and sets `status = "canceled"`
4. On cancellation, the app downgrades the org to free tier and removes excess team members


#### Stripe Webhook Setup

**Webhook endpoint:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/stripe/webhook`

Enable these webhooks in your Stripe Dashboard:

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Handle completed checkout sessions |
| `customer.created` | Track new Stripe customers |
| `customer.subscription.created` | New subscription created |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Subscription ended/canceled |
| `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` | Trial ending soon (3 days before) |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Plan changes, status updates |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Payment declined |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | Payment successful |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Payment method or payment attempt failed |

## Configuring Plans

Plans are defined in `shared/utils/plans.ts` — the single source of truth for pricing, features, and Stripe price IDs.

```typescript
export const PLANS = {
  PRO_MONTHLY: {
    id: 'pro-monthly-v2',
    priceId: 'price_yyy',        // Your Stripe Price ID
    key: 'pro',
    interval: 'month',
    label: 'Monthly',
    priceNumber: 11.99,
    seatPriceNumber: 5.99,
    trialDays: 14,
    features: ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2']
  },
  PRO_YEARLY: {
    id: 'pro-yearly-v2',
    priceId: 'price_zzz',
    key: 'pro',
    interval: 'year',
    label: 'Yearly',
    priceNumber: 99.99,
    seatPriceNumber: 44.44,
    description: 'Save ~45%',
    trialDays: 14,
    features: ['Feature 1', 'Feature 2']
  }
}
```

**Helper functions:**

```typescript
import { findPlanById, findPlanByPriceId, normalizePlanId } from '~~/shared/utils/plans'

findPlanById('pro-monthly-v2')
findPlanByPriceId('price_xxx')
normalizePlanId('pro-monthly-v2-no-trial') // → 'pro-monthly-v2'
```

### Legacy Pricing

Keep old plan entries in the file — existing subscribers are matched by `priceId` and stay on their original pricing. If they cancel and re-subscribe, they get current pricing.

## Reusable Components

**Billing:**
- `usePaymentStatus()` — check `isPaymentFailed`, `hasUsedTrial`, `activeSub`
- `<BillingPaymentFailedBanner />` — global warning banner
- `<BillingPaymentFailedCard />` — action card with payment update buttons

**Settings:**
- `<SettingsGeneralSection />` — org name, slug, timezone
- `<SettingsApiKeysSection />` — API key management
- `<SettingsSessionsSection />` — active sessions
- `<SettingsDangerZone />` — leave/delete org

**Members:**
- `<MembersInviteForm />` — invite with seat limit checking
- `useTimezone()` — timezone list and formatting
